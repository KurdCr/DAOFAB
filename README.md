 # DAOFAB Solution

## 1: Display Parent Transactions

- Implemented a REST API to fetch data and enable server-side pagination.
- Created a table to display parent transactions.
- Added the ability to sort the table by parent Id.

## 2: Display Children Data

- Implemented a REST API to fetch child data.
- Created a table to display the children's data.
- Sort children's data by Id.


## Data Source

- The data for parent transactions and children payments was read from two provided JSON files: `Parent.json` and `Child.json`.
- Please note that before running the backend, you need to update the absolute paths of the JSON files in the `JsonParserService` class located at `src/main/java/com/daofab/daofab/Service/JsonParserService.java`.

## Code Structure

- The backend code is implemented in Java using the Spring framework.
- The frontend code is developed using React.
